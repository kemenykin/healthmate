            <p>Keep in mind:</p>
            <p>These calculations are based on general formulas and may not be accurate for everyone. For example, the formula for calculating daily calorie needs is based on average values and doesn't take into account factors such as individual metabolism, activity level, and body composition. So, it might be a good idea to provide some information on the limitations of these calculations and encourage users to consult with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian for personalized advice.</p>
